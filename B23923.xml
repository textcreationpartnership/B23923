            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Hard CASE OF THE GLASS-MAKERS Of <hi>England,</hi> and the Danger of losing the said Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, by reason of the Duties laid upon Glass-Wares, most Humbly Represented to this Honourable House.</head>
            <p>INasmuch as the said Duty (if continued) will unavoidable prove the Ruine of the Artists, who have, to the great Advantage of this Nation, brought the Glass-Manufacture to very great Perfection, even to a Prohibition of the Importation thereof.</p>
            <p n="1">1st, For the Reason Glass before the said Duty was Sold as cheap as possible, to get a Livelyhood thereby.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, The said Duty hath so lessened the Consumption of Glass, that one third part of the Glass made the last Quarter, lyes on the Makers Hands; and the Consumption grows lesser and lesser every Day: By which means the Maker is forced to Sell his Glass 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Cheaper then before the said Duty, rather than to have their Glass lye on their Hands, to break and grow out of Fashion, (as it will do) and want Money to pay Wages to Workmen, who by Contract before the said Duty, they are obliged to Imploy, or pay them Play-Wages for nothing.</p>
            <p>Which being considered, must unavoidably Ruine the Maker in a short time, and then consequently the Workmen must be Ruined, and forced into <hi>Ireland, Scotland,</hi> and other Places to get Bread; which Places are so sensible of Matter of Fact, as already to Erect Works for their Reception; which, if not prevented, must unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable prove the Loss of Glass-Manufacture to this Nation.</p>
            <p>It is therefore most Humbly Hoped, the Members of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable House, will take into their serious Consideration the Ruine of the poor Workmen (some of which have not had 14 Days Work, since the Commencement of the said Duty) and be Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pleased to prevent the same; especially considering the said Duty is very inconsiderable to the Crown; it being most evident, and plainly to be made appear, the Duty of what Glass was made the last Quarter, did not amount to 5000 <hi>l.</hi> out of which the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back and Collecting must be Deducted, and then not 3000 <hi>l.</hi> will be coming to the Crown; and that is more then any following Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will produce, for the Reasons aforesaid.</p>
